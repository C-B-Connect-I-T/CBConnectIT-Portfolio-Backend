To facilitate seamless data communication, I integrated third-party libraries for processing RESTful API, the bulk of it being handled in the Core library.

He kept me updated, had intermediate updates and was very clear in what feature was possible or would be a little more difficult to achieve. The end result was a very nice looking, usability friendly and functional application. I also managed to get a glimps of his coaching attitude when he was explaining certain technical steps in a friendly and understandable, yet concrete, way to me. Since a recent amount of time I have started working more in IT myself, as a test engineer. He has been a supportive help in the process as after -support.

Instead of copying a lot of classes and reimplementing it differently each time, a single dependency was all we needed.\n\nBecause the company worked on multiple projects a year, it was quite usual that we did a lot of manual setup like copy a lot of base and util classes over to the new project, maybe tweak them a little bit and then continue with the actual project. This resulted in a lot of differences in the code bases and scattered knowledge between coworkers. To circumvent this issue, I created a base library where the base classes and some util class (later extension functions) where placed. All accessible by a user friendly Builder class to initialize all needed pieces.\n\nAlso the network layer had a complete makeover to add a (streamlined) default way of work, taking pieces of all previous projects and coworkers to create a cohesive and robust basis. It had also some plug and play functionalities to cater to some project specific needs.\n\nThe library was comprised out of different modules. For example, there was the actual Core module, then we had the Networking module with retrofit usability. Besides that we also had modules for local data, starting with Realm which was Deprecated in favor of Room after a couple of versions.\n\nCheck the Github for more information and a sample!",

In conjunction with Jetpack Compose, I also used the recommended way of a State object with the UiEVent and Event classes.\n\nThese new classes ensured the layout only gets updated whenever the state is being updated and actions will trigger an event which will then trigger a change in the state or trigger other events back to the UI. By doing things this way (the new classes + DI) it should be a lot easier to test all the other components of the applications.
